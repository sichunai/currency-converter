Thanks for your interest in working at Dwight Funding!
In this folder there is a template for a NodeJS & React App using Express. 

For this assessment we are going to test your full stack development skills. 
We are going to create a currency exchange app, which allows the user to input a currency and value and select what currency to exchange it to. 

Here is the API we recommend using: https://www.exchangerate-api.com/


Requirements:

1. Allow user to input current currency and value and desired currency 
2. Must send the request to your NodeJS backend server to process
3. Call this API https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ to process the request
4. Use a one page app to process these requests.
